## Abstract
Timely detection of persistent and emerging pathogens is critical to controlling disease spread, particularly in high-density populations with increased contact between individuals and limited-to-no ability to quarantine. Standard molecular diagnostic tests for surveying pathogenic microbes have provided the sensitivity needed for early detection, but lag in time-to-result leading to delayed action. On-site diagnostics alleviate this lag, but current technologies are less sensitive and adaptable than lab-based molecular methods. Towards the development of improved on-site diagnostics, we demonstrated the adaptability of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification-CRISPR coupled technology by creating two CRISPR-based fluorescent assays capable of detecting DNA and RNA viruses that greatly impact shrimp populations; White Spot Syndrome Virus and Taura Syndrome Virus. Both assays showed the same sensitivity and accuracy for viral load quantification as qPCR. Additionally, both assays specifically targeted their respective virus with no false positives detected in animals infected with other common viruses or in certified pathogen-free animals.
**IMPORTANCE:** Highly sensitive and specific CRISPR-based diagnostics, such as those developed here for shrimp viral diseases, have the potential to revolutionize disease management in agriculture and aquaculture helping to promote global food security.
