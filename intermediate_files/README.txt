- [all_SHERLOCK_data_filtering.csv](): Table containing all SHERLOCK data for each reaction. Header is as follows: 'date' is the experimental date; 'virus' is the target virus of the assay; 'Sample Name' is the name of the sample; 'template' is the nickname for the sample; 'num_reps' is the total number of technical replicate reactions run for the sample; 'median' is the median CT for the sample; 'count' is the number of technical replicates that had a CT value (if the CT value was undetermined the technical replicate is not counted); 'at_least_3CTvals
' denotes if the sample should be kept or removed (if sample has more than 50% of technical replicates with CT values, the sample is kept. if not, the sample is removed); 'Well' and 'Well Position' denote the plate location; 'CT' is the CT value assigned by the qPCR software; 'Replicate' denotes the technical replicate number; 'sample_type' specifies if the sample is a standard or unknown sample; 'medDist1_method' denotes if replicate should be kept or removed based on whether it has a CT value within the median CT +/- 1 (this removes outliers). 'count2' is the number of technical replicates with CT values that are within the median CT +/- 1. 'at_least_3CTvals_aftOut' denotes whether the sample should be kept based on having at least 50% of technical replicates that are not outliers or removed.
